# GOLD Impulse with Alert

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) called 'GOLD Impulse with Alert'. It is a Forex strength indicator that measures the strength of the XAUUSD (Gold) currency pair. It is developed by Forex Robot Easy and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/gold-impulse-review-unmatched-forex-strength-indicator/).

## Functionality

The indicator uses two other custom indicators, 'Advanced Currency IMPULSE with ALERT' and 'Currency Strength Exotics', to calculate and display the strength of the XAUUSD currency pair. It also provides trading signals based on the strength readings.

The `OnInit()` function initializes the indicators and sets the additional symbol to XAUUSD. The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation and processing function that is executed for each new tick received.

The code also includes custom trading functions (`BuySignal()` and `SellSignal()`) that can be executed when buy or sell signals are generated. Custom alert functions (`Alert()`) can be used to execute specific alert logic. Custom graphical functions (`DrawAcceleration()` and `DrawIndicator()`) can be used to draw graphical representations of the currency strength acceleration and the GOLD Impulse Forex Strength Indicator, respectively.
